# Rules for Plus

_Author_: Viola SÃ¶derlund, violaso@kth.se

## $\Alpha.$ Collaborative learning.

$\Alpha.I.$ All assignment repositories are public. 

$\Alpha.II.$ Always attemp your best before consulting your friend's repositories for direction.

$\Alpha.III.$ It is encouraged to push additional commits in line with your friends' public solutions on top of your complete solution, if you find their implementations enticing.

_Purpose_: Collaborative learning can be fun and efficient. The goal of an education is to learn, so if you learn from reading your friends solutions, we all profit.

## $\Beta.$ Fail successfully.

$\Beta.I.$ You are permitted to fail, miserably. Only if ($a$) you publish your submission in this organisation, and ($b$) you publish clear issues in which you describe your problems and failures. It should be clear that you tried you best.

$\Beta.II.$ Even if you complete an assignment, write issues for what you predict as possible improvements for your solution.

$\Beta.III.$ You are encouraged to help your friends in solving their issues.

_Purpose_: You will probably spend your future mending, mutating, judging, and fixing, other peoples' code. This is a good exercise.

## $\Gamma.$ We are in this together.

$\Gamma.I.$ Are you stuck? You don't want to give up on your  particular approach? Ask for help in issues or on Discord.

$\Gamma.II.$ Are your friend stuck? Help your friend, preferably in a common channel so that everyone can learn from it.

$\Gamma.III.$ Do you find an error in the assignment instructions, or in any support document in this repository, write an issue.

_Purpose_: Your future is not as a solo-coder, but as a team member. Valuble skills include the ability to evaluate and help your friends with their work.
