## Submission Format

Turn your submission in by pushing any relevant work to your regular upstream, _inda-25_ at KTH Github.

In case you submit any plus assignment, or if you like to share your Java course work, also push to your plus upstream, _IndaPlus25_ at the official Github.

Make sure to include all of your work, as well as any possible proofs. Don't forget your Kattis screenshots.

### Structure

* __Only regular__: Follow the instructions as given in the regular task instructions.
* __Only +__: You may discard any files that belong to the regular task, and replace them with your plus project root.
* __Both__: Put the tasks in two seperate project roots, one directory `regular`, and another `plus`.

You are allowed to push a bonus task, such as that of ++, or a personal project to present to the group.

## Grading

The grade to an assigment is left in the form of an issue with "Pass", "Komplettering", or "Fail" in the title. In case of "Komplettering", read the instructions on what to adjust down in the issue description. Link any relevant new commits, and leave a comment on the issue upon reupload of the assignment. "Pass" and "Fail" are self explanatory.
